# Contributing to GDLang

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GDLang! We welcome all contributions and value the opportunity to work together to improve this project. To ensure a positive, productive, and respectful collaboration, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

## Basic Guidelines for Contributing

1. **Fork the Project**:  
   - Start by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [GDLang](https://github.com/jorelosorio/gdlang) repository. This allows you to work on your own version of the code.
   
2. **Stay Up-to-Date**:  
   - Before making any changes, make sure you're working from the latest version by running `git checkout main` in your fork. This ensures you are working from the most up-to-date codebase.

3. **Create a Dedicated Branch**:  
   - Always create a branch for your work. Avoid working directly on `main`. Use a descriptive branch name like `git checkout -b your-nickname/feature-name` to clarify the purpose of your changes.
   
4. **Keep Changes Focused**:  
   - Please ensure that each pull request (PR) addresses a single concern or feature. If you have multiple unrelated changes, break them into separate branches and PRs. This helps maintain a clear and understandable codebase.

## Code of Conduct

We expect contributors to foster a positive environment. Here are a few key points to keep in mind:

- **Respect Others**: Please be polite and respectful towards other contributors and maintainers. Personal attacks, harassment, or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Be open to feedback and discussion. We're all here to improve the project, and constructive dialogue is key to achieving that.
- **Ownership and Accountability**: If you make a mistake or break something, it's okay! Just be responsible, open about it, and try to fix it as quickly as possible.
- **Inclusion and Diversity**: We encourage contributions from developers of all backgrounds and experiences. Help us maintain an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome.

## Filing Issues

When submitting an issue, please provide the following details to help us understand and address it effectively:

1. **GDLang Version**:  
   - Which version of GDLang Compiler or VM are you using? (`gdc -version` or `gdvm -version`)
   
2. **Operating System and Architecture**:  
   - Which operating system and processor architecture are you using?

3. **Description of the Problem**:  
   - What action did you take that caused the issue? 

4. **Expected Behavior**:  
   - What did you expect to happen?

5. **Actual Behavior**:  
   - What actually happened instead?

Providing this information helps us troubleshoot and resolve issues more quickly.

## Making Changes

- **Follow Coding Standards**: Ensure your code follows the project's coding guidelines, and keep it clean, organized, and well-documented.
- **Test Your Changes**: Before submitting your pull request, make sure your changes pass all tests and do not introduce any regressions.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages to explain the "what" and "why" behind your changes.
